# How To Help
Thank you for considering to contribute! Here are some things you can help with, in no particular order:

- fixing a typo
  - in the Project Flask itself (look for the pen icon at the top right)
  - on Project Flask website not found (scroll all the way down and click "edit this page")
  - on the No WIKI FOUND (login and click "Edit this page")
- improving an existing bug report
  - figuring out which Minecraft versions are affected by the bug
  - Can you figure out how to make the bug happen every time? If so, please let me know.
    - The ["could not reproduce"](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/labels/could%20not%20reproduce) label lists bug reports where I haven't been able to figure this out.
